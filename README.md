- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @agenttoxa (telegram, VK)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, web-apps. Sometime Python, Java, C++.


My name is Anton. I'm interested in web-development. Recently I have been studying and using NodeJS (ExpressJS + Nuxt Apps).
I have been working in web development for 4 years, And only now I decided to connect github.
Most of my projects are commercial web applications. But maybe I'll post something experimental here. Myself mostly.
